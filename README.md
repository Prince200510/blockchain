## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of a blockchain smart contract written in Solidity with a React.js frontend. The project includes:

- A Solidity smart contract to store and modify a count variable.
- A React.js frontend that allows users to interact with the contract through MetaMask.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Solidity, Web3.js)
- **Tools**: MetaMask, Ganache (for local testing), Truffle/Remix (for contract deployment)

## Features

- Users can connect their MetaMask wallet.
- Interact with the blockchain by incrementing and decrementing the count stored on the blockchain.
- Display the current count value in the React.js UI.
  
## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Git
- MetaMask (installed as a browser extension)
- A local blockchain environment like Ganache (optional for local testing)

### Clone the Repository
